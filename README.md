<h1>Introduction</h1>
This repository contains the source code and documentation for creating a custom Linux shell in the C programming language. The shell is a command-line interpreter that facilitates interaction with the Linux operating system.

Features
Basic command execution
Input and output redirection
Pipe implementation
Custom prompt design
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Linux operating system
GCC compiler installed
Building the Shell

Start entering commands and exploring the shell functionalities.
Usage
Basic Commands: Enter standard Linux commands like ls, cd, pwd, etc.
Redirection: Use > for output redirection and < for input redirection.
